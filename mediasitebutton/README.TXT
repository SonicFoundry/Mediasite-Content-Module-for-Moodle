Overview
==========

    The Mediasite Atto Editor Plugin allows instructors to link secured Mediasite content to a page in a Moodle course. Instructors can add new Mediasite links by searching for or creating presentations on the Mediasite Server. Once a link to a Mediasite presentation is added to a course, students can view the content without authenticating to the Mediasite Server using a different username. The Mediasite Atto Editor Plugin allows students to submit videos to Moodle assignments. The assignment submissions are stored securely in Mediasite for grading.
